### **Central China Normal University**

**Masterâ€™s Research**  
*Wuhan, China | Sep 2021 - July 2024*  
*Supervised by Asst. Prof. Xu Li*

#### Project 1: *Cognitive Mechanisms of Working Memory Plasticity in Older Adults*  
*Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, PI: Prof. Xu Li*

- **Literature Review**: Conducted systematic reviews of the literature on cognitive aging and working memory plasticity, establishing a foundation for the theoretical framework.
  
- **Data Analysis and Technical Support**: Processed and analyzed EEG data from over 60 participants using EEGLAB and custom MATLAB scripts. Managed equipment calibration and ensured regular data backups.
  
- **Report Writing**: Contributed to research papers and internal reports summarizing key findings on cognitive aging and memory plasticity.

#### Project 2: *Working Memory Bias Correction in Individuals with Depressive Tendencies*  
*Funded by the MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences, PI: Asst. Prof. Xu Li*

- **Literature Review and Study Design**: Reviewed literature on working memory biases in depression to guide the hypothesis and experimental design. Assisted in creating a protocol to assess and correct these biases.
  
- **Experiment Execution and Data Analysis**: Oversaw participant recruitment and managed data collection for 80 participants, ensuring adherence to experimental protocols. Performed statistical analyses using SPSS and MATLAB, testing key hypotheses.
  
- **Reporting and Administrative Support**: Authored detailed research reports and collaborated on manuscript drafts. Coordinated logistical aspects of the study, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and managing resources across departments.
