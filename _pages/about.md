Hello! I am a research assistant at the [Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.psych.ac.cn/), with a deep passion for **Psychology**. As a first-generation college student, I have been fortunate to attend the Civil Aviation University of China for my undergraduate studies and Central China Normal University for my master’s degree in psychology. These experiences have deeply nurtured my passion for psychology and motivated me to pursue advanced research in cognitive science. My research interests focus on how certain stimuli capture our attention, how the visual system represents the world, and how information is subsequently encoded and integrated into memory. Additionally, I am intrigued by the capacity and structure of visual working memory and its connections to other cognitive abilities.
