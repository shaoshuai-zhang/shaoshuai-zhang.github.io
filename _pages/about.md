Hello! I am a research assistant at the [Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.psych.ac.cn/), with a deep passion for **cognitive neuroscience**. My research interests focus on how certain stimuli capture our attention, how the visual system represents the world, and how information is subsequently encoded and integrated into memory. Additionally, I am intrigued by the capacity and structure of visual working memory and its connections to other cognitive abilities.

My research explores questions such as:

*   Why is some information easier to remember while other details are more challenging to retain?

*   How does aging affect distractor resistance in working memory, and does emotional valence play a role?

*   What are the patterns of attention bias and working memory bias in individuals with social anxiety?

*   How does the visual system process biological and non-biological motion?
